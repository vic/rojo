Rubijs
======

A Rubinius bytecode interpreter running in JavaScript.

Remember HotRuby ? Something like that but for rubinius bytecode.

# Why?

I want to learn Rubinius VM internals. So I'll be reading
the source code and trying to port the instruction interpreter
to javascript. Creating a minimalist rubinius core.
